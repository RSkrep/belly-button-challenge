# belly-button-challenge

for this challenge we were required to create a website using javascript to demonstare the data we collected 
we did this in the 7 steps that follow


1.Use the D3 library to read in samples.json from the URL https://2u-data-curriculum-team.s3.amazonaws.com/dataviz-classroom/v1.1/14-Interactive-Web-Visualizations/02-Homework/samples.json.

2.Create a horizontal bar chart with a dropdown menu to display the top 10 OTUs found in that individual.

    Use sample_values as the values for the bar chart.

    Use otu_ids as the labels for the bar chart.

    Use otu_labels as the hovertext for the chart.

3.Create a bubble chart that displays each sample.

    Use otu_ids for the x values.

    Use sample_values for the y values.

    Use sample_values for the marker size.

    Use otu_ids for the marker colors.

    Use otu_labels for the text values.
4.Display the sample metadata, i.e., an individual's demographic information.
5.Display each key-value pair from the metadata JSON object somewhere on the page.


6.Update all the plots when a new sample is selected. Additionally, you are welcome to create any layout that you would like for your dashboard.

7.Deploy your app to a free static page hosting service, such as GitHub Pages. Submit the links to your deployment and your GitHub repo. 

Completion process I would first attempt to solve each of the tasks using my memory, then I would look into the class notes and activities as a way to find out my next course of action when I was lost. After doing these steps I would consult ChatGPT to find out where I went wrong and would use its assistance to correct the code as well as explain its process to me so I could understand for the future how to fulfill these tasks without aid. When all else failed i would utalize the help of my fellow classmates and instructors to guide me in the right path
